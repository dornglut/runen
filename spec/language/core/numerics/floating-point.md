# Core Floating-Point Semantics

Status: **provisional normative; incomplete**

Runen distinguishes three floating-point contracts:

- **standard** — portable baseline without arbitrary fast-math transformations;
- **reproducible** — stronger cross-realization repeatability, with emulation or rejection when required;
- **fast** — explicit documented numerical relaxations.

## Numeric-contract authority

For every floating-point operation governed by this contract system, an applicable Runen semantic context MUST establish exactly one of `standard`, `reproducible`, or `fast` before physical realization. How source selects that contract and which contract, if any, is the source default are not defined by this revision.

The selected numeric contract is semantic input. It is not a target class, backend capability, compiler optimization level, runtime mode, hardware feature, or realization choice. A realization MUST preserve every applicable rule of the selected contract and MUST NOT silently substitute another numeric contract because a target lacks a preferred operation or exposes additional numerical transformation freedom.

When direct realization is unavailable, an implementation MAY use emulation when that emulation preserves the selected contract. If satisfying the selected contract requires a hard environment capability, the applicable contract MUST expose that requirement to environment admission, where it is either admitted or rejected according to the language lifecycle. Once admitted, inability to realize the contract directly is not permission to weaken it.

A physical implementation may use greater internal precision or another stronger implementation technique only when the resulting Runen-observable behavior remains permitted by the selected contract. Physical mechanism does not strengthen, weaken, or replace the semantic contract by itself.

The `fast` contract authorizes only numerical relaxations that Runen explicitly grants to `fast`; enabling a backend's aggregate fast-math mode does not by itself make all of that mode's transformations legal. Conversely, `standard` and `reproducible` gain no implicit transformation freedom merely because a target or backend supports it.

## Contract refinement

`standard` supplies the baseline floating-point numerical obligations and permissions.

`reproducible` follows every applicable `standard` rule, except only to the extent that a `reproducible`-specific rule strengthens an obligation or narrows the numerical behavior permitted by that rule. A `reproducible`-specific rule MUST NOT weaken an applicable `standard` requirement or admit numerical behavior that the applicable `standard` rule forbids.

`fast` follows every applicable `standard` rule, except only to the extent that a `fast`-specific rule explicitly grants an additional numerical relaxation for behavior that rule names. In the absence of such a `fast`-specific relaxation, the applicable `standard` rule remains controlling. Selecting `fast` is therefore not a general license to ignore unspecified baseline requirements.

A `fast` numerical relaxation does not by implication relax evaluation authority, effects, control flow, memory semantics, Exec ordering or synchronization, resource rules, or another non-numeric semantic contract. Any change to those semantics requires authority from their own normative owners.

These refinement relationships compose the obligations of an already-selected numeric contract. They do not select a contract for an operation and do not authorize a realization to switch contracts; the numeric-contract authority rules above remain controlling.

## Reassociation

Under `standard` and `reproducible`, semantic grouping of separately represented floating-point additions or multiplications is result-significant. A realization MUST NOT use real-number associativity to regroup those operations when doing so can change Runen-observable behavior permitted by the selected contract. A realization MAY physically restructure the computation when it proves that the resulting behavior still satisfies the selected contract.

Under `fast`, a realization MAY reassociate a pure finite tree of already-established floating-point operand values when every internal operation in that tree is addition, or when every internal operation in that tree is multiplication. Reassociation may change only the grouping of those operations: the ordered leaf-value sequence and the operation kind MUST remain unchanged.

This `fast` permission does not authorize operand permutation, omission, duplication, substitution of another operation, reciprocal replacement, contraction or fused multiply-add formation, reduced precision, approximate functions, assumptions about NaN, infinity, or signed zero, or changes to the evaluation or effects by which the leaf values were obtained. Every other applicable `fast` rule continues to constrain the reassociated computation and its result.

Reassociation under this section is not authority to choose an Exec unordered-reduction tree or to treat floating addition or multiplication as satisfying a reduction combination law. Exec reduction participation, contribution coverage, and combination obligations remain independently applicable.

Exact operation accuracy, contraction or FMA behavior, transcendental behavior, NaN handling, subnormal handling, rounding and conversion behavior, reduction-specific numeric equivalence, the remaining detailed `standard`/`reproducible`/`fast` result sets, source contract selection/defaulting, and the concrete hard requirements for unsupported direct realization are not defined by this revision.
